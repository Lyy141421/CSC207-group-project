HRAddOrUpdatePostingForm:
    The only field that can be left blank is document.
    Application close date must be at least one day past today. (It will only show up in HR as under review the day after close date)
    If you choose to enter tags through the textbox, it will only be valid if there is at least 1 alphanumeric character.

HRViewApp:
    This is a special page. We would've disabled the menu bar if we had more time. Please DO NOT clickck anything on the menu bar.
    You should at least see 1 button on the screen. If it's return, it sends you back to where you came into this panel from.
    Otherwise you're supposed to be locked into this panel (Again. Don't use the menu bar). The button sends you to some
    tasks you need to finish before you can leave this panel.

Dialogs:
    The closing operation (x) should be disabled on all important dialogs. Please do NOT try to close them.

HR's tasks:
    HR mainly handles: creating job posting, reviewing applications immediately after a job posting closes, set all
    interview rounds formats, scheduling group interview when needed, and making hiring decisions. Create job posting
    is in it's own panel; scheduling group interview can be accessed in view job posting when the JP needing group
    interview is selected; the rest should all be accessed by selecting the specific job posting and clicking view
    applications.

    Immediately after interview rounds formats are set, if the first round is a group interview, it will not show up in
    high priority job postings until you have returned to home panel (by clicking return on view app, then clicking home
    from view jp)
