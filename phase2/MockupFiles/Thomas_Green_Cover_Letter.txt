Dear Ms. Hopkins:

I found your posting on Get A Job for a network administrator and knew I wanted to apply immediately.
ABC Corporationâ€™s reputation for responsive service and proactive support differentiates your company from the rest,
and I would like to be part of your dynamic team.

Since graduating from XYZ College with a BS in computer science, I have worked for three years as a network administrator
for DEF Company. In this role, I am valued as a solutions-focused manager of networks, IT systems, user support functions
and technology projects. I have experience in all areas covered in your job ad, including:

- Network and Server Design and Administration
- LAN, WAN, VPN, SAN and VoIP Infrastructure
- Network Analysis and Optimization
- System Security, Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans
- Cloud Computing and Data Storage
- Enterprise System and Software Implementations

Known as a keen technical trouble-shooter, I am dedicated to providing cost-effective and expedient solutions optimizing
network stability and security; improving performance of systems and equipment; and resolving issues such as network crashes,
system slowdowns and virus outbreaks.

At DEF Company, I provide world-class service technical support in an enterprise environment, and I am confident I would
quickly become a productive network administrator at ABC Corporation. If you agree, please call me at (555) 555-5555 to
set up an interview.
